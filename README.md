This simple pokedex contains all 151 original, generation 1 Pokemon. It loads data from an API and displays each pokemon's name on a button that opens up a bootstrap modal displaying corresponding stats.

I utilized the following to make the application:
-Javascript (plain)
-Jquery
-CSS
-Bootstrap
-A pokemon related API

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the listed languages and libraries as well as the concepts needed to implement them.
